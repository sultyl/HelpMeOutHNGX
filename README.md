This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
It is a frontend repository for a google chrome extension that I built

Here is the extension link [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vsMaAycJIIm9IJeEkseAjBH2hFhSK9-i]

TO get to the guest page here is the link
[https://helpmeout-hngx-extension.vercel.app/guest/GuestPage]

After downloading the contents in a single folder you extract it and then open your chrome extension and change it to developer mode then select load unpacked and then paste the folder there then go to your extensions tab and then pin the extension then click on the start recording to start your screen record

## Getting Started after cloning
```git clone```
```npm install --legacy-peer-deps```
then, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
